Hey, I’m Rudraksh 👋

I’m an engineering student who enjoys building things that actually work, especially projects that involve data, logic, and problem-solving. I like taking an idea, breaking it down, and turning it into something usable, whether that’s a small script or a full project.

Most of my work revolves around Python, data handling, and experimenting with different approaches to solve real-world problems. I’ve built projects in areas like transaction analysis, automation, and basic web applications, and I focus a lot on keeping my code readable and structured.

This profile is a collection of things I’ve built while learning and improving. I’m always trying to understand how systems work under the hood and how to make them better with time.
